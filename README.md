# Chandrayaan 3 TDD Assessment
## Problem Statement
**Chandrayaan 3 Lunar Craft: Galactic Space Craft Control**

#### Description
As a scientist at ISRO controlling the latest lunar spacecraft Chandrayaan 3, your task is to develop a program that translates commands sent from Earth into instructions understood by the spacecraft. The spacecraft navigates through the galaxy using galactic coordinates, represented by x, y, z coordinates (x for east or west location, y for north or south location, and z for distance above or below the galactic plane).

#### Requirements
You will be given the initial starting point (x, y, z) of the spacecraft and the direction it is facing (N, S, E, W, Up, Down). The spacecraft receives a character array of commands, and you are required to implement the following functionalities:

Move the spacecraft forward/backward (f, b): The spacecraft moves one step forward or backward based on its current direction.
Turn the spacecraft left/right (l, r): The spacecraft rotates 90 degrees to the left or right, changing its facing direction.
Turn the spacecraft up/down (u, d): The spacecraft changes its angle, rotating upwards or downwards.
#### Note:

The spacecraft‚Äôs initial direction (N, S, E, W, Up, Down) represents the reference frame for movement and rotation.
The spacecraft cannot move or rotate diagonally; it can only move in the direction it is currently facing.
Assume that the spacecraft‚Äôs movement and rotations are rigid, and it cannot move beyond the galactic boundaries.
#### Example
Given the starting point (0, 0, 0) following (x, y, z) and initial direction N, the following commands should result in the indicated final position and direction:

Commands: [‚Äúf‚Äù, ‚Äúr‚Äù, ‚Äúu‚Äù, ‚Äúb‚Äù, ‚Äúl‚Äù]

Starting Position: (0, 0, 0)

Initial Direction: N

‚Äúf‚Äù - (0, 1, 0) - N
‚Äúr‚Äù - (0, 1, 0) - E
‚Äúu‚Äù - (0, 1, 0) - U
‚Äúb‚Äù - (0, 1, -1) - U
‚Äúl‚Äù - (0, 1, -1) - N
**Final Position:** (0, 1, -1)

**Final Direction:** N
## Project Setup

### Clone the Repository

To get started with the Chandrayaan 3 Lunar Craft Control project, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramshatarannum/Chandrayaan-test-task.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd Chandrayaan-test-task
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using Bundler:

```bash
bundle install
```

### Database Setup

Create and migrate the database:

```bash
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```

### Run the Server

Start the Rails server:

```bash
rails server
```
or
```bash
rails s
```

## Testing

### Add RSpec to the Gemfile

Open your project's Gemfile and add the `rspec-rails` gem to the `:development, :test` group:

```ruby
gem 'rspec-rails', group: [:development, :test]
```

Install the gem:

```bash
bundle install
```

### Initialize RSpec

Generate the RSpec configuration files:

```bash
rails generate rspec:install
```

### Run RSpec

Execute RSpec to run your tests:

```bash
rspec
```
or
```bash
rspec spec/models
```
